You are a senior business-analytics AI advisor with deep experience in designing, validating and continuously monitoring distributor and retailer incentive programs in manufacturing and CPG industries.

**Context:**  
• Company ABC sells products (in metric tonnes) to distributors → retailers → end customers.  
• Incentive Scheme Type 1 (“Volume-Growth Scheme”): Distributors are grouped into “Sections” by last-year base-period volumes; within each section their percentage growth year-on-year triggers per-tonne incentive rates.  
• These schemes are run monthly via the PQR software; the verification team currently checks correctness of input parameters, per-customer incentive rates, total incentive amounts, and base-vs. scheme-period volumes.

**Your Task:**  
1. **Propose a comprehensive set of “macro-level” validation and business-alignment checks** that go beyond single-run correctness to ensure the schemes—over time—drive desired business outcomes, stay financially sound, and remain competitive.  
2. **Anchor your recommendations** in lessons learned from similar programs at other manufacturing or CPG companies, citing real-world best practices where relevant.  
3. **Organize your output** into the following sections:
   - **A. Long-Term Trend and Stability Checks**  
     • E.g., analyze month-over-month and year-over-year incentive spend as % of gross margin; detect sudden spikes or erosion.  
   - **B. Business KPI Alignment**  
     • E.g., correlation between incentive-driven volume growth and overall revenue, margin, market share.  
   - **C. Forecast vs. Actual & Scenario Analysis**  
     • E.g., use rolling forecasts to project incentive cost and sales uplift; compare to actuals to flag persistent overruns or under-performance.  
   - **D. ROI and Payback Metrics**  
     • E.g., compute incremental profit per rupee of incentive across sections, products, regions.  
   - **E. Anomaly & Change-Point Detection**  
     • E.g., detect customers or regions whose growth patterns suddenly diverge from peers, possibly indicating data errors or strategic shifts.  
   - **F. Business-Process and Operational Checks**  
     • E.g., link incentive outcomes to supply-chain metrics (stock‐outs, lead times) and distributor health indicators (days-sales-outstanding, churn).  
   - **G. Competitive Benchmarking & External Factors**  
     • E.g., compare realized growth patterns against market-level trends (industry sales indices, competitor promotions) to catch cannibalization or market shrinkage.  
4. **For each check**, specify:
   - **Data sources required** (e.g., PQR outputs, ERP sales ledgers, finance P&L, CRM churn reports, external market indices).  
   - **Analytical method or statistic** (e.g., rolling-window CAGR, z-score anomaly detection, regression analysis).  
   - **Frequency of execution** (e.g., daily dashboards vs. monthly reviews vs. quarterly deep dives).  
   - **Thresholds or guardrails** (e.g., % of margin spent on incentives > X%; YOY incentive‐to-growth ratio outside 0.8–1.2 range).  
   - **Recommended escalation or corrective action** when a check fails.

**Output Format:**  
• A well-structured report outline.  
• Bullet points under each of A–G with all of the above details.  
• A short “Executive Summary” at the top summarizing the key categories of macro checks.

Go deep—treat this like designing the next generation of your incentive-governance and analytics framework. Draw on real CPG/manufacturing examples you know of, and propose novel but practical checks that ABC’s verification team can automate or periodically review.
